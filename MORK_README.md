# MORK Persistence Integration

This directory contains the integration of **MORK**, a high-performance reasoning engine designed for large-scale biological knowledge graphs.

Our implementation focuses on a **"Convert-then-Load" workflow**, which transforms BioCypher's text-based .metta exports into optimized binary `.paths` indices. This approach allows us to:
1.  **Bypass Parsing Overhead**: Skip the expensive text parsing step on subsequent loads.
2.  **Achieve MM2-Scale Performance**: Load large number of atoms in seconds rather than hours.
3.  **Enable Persistent Reasoning**: Query the graph instantly via a high-speed Rust server.

# 1. Setup Environment

We configured the MORK service to use a persistent volume, ensuring data access across container restarts.

*   **Docker Configuration**: Modified `docker-compose.yml` to mount the local `output/` directory (containing BioCypher exports) to `/app/data` inside the MORK container.
*   **Networking**: Exposed host port `8027` mapped to container port `8027` to allow external HTTP API access.

## 2. Loading Strategy (The "Convert & Load" Workflow)

To solve the performance bottleneck of parsing `.metta` files on every restart, we implemented a two-step loading process:

**(A) Conversion (One-time)**
We created a script (`scripts/convert_topaths.py`) that compiles text-based `.metta` files into optimized binary `.paths` indices.
*   **Why**: Bypasses the expensive text parser on subsequent loads.
*   **How**: It checks file timestamps and only re-compiles files that have changed since the last run (incremental build).

**(B) Persistence (Every restart)**
We created a loader script (`scripts/load_paths.py`) that instructs MORK to memory-map these binary files.
*   **How**: It iterates through the `.paths` files and calls the MORK API to load them into the `annotation` namespace.
*   **Result**: The entire graph becomes available for querying almost instantly (microseconds per file) because it is mapped directly from disk to memory.

## 3. Execution of Queries

Once loaded, we query the graph using the MORK HTTP API, wrapped in a Python client.

*   **Mechanism**: The `mork.download(pattern, template)` method sends a request to the `/export/` endpoint.
*   **Scope**: Queries are executed against the `annotation` namespace where all binary paths are merged.

**Example Query Pattern:**
To find a specific transcript entity, we use the following Python code:

```python
# 1. Define the Pattern to match
pattern = "(transcript ENST00000353224)"

# 2. Define the Template (what to return)
template = "$x" # Return the matching atom itself

# 3. Execute the Query
result = scope.download(pattern, template)
```

## 4. How to Execute (The Workflow)

To run the full end-to-end process, execute these commands in order:

### A. Start MORK Service
Initialize the high-performance Rust server.
```bash
docker-compose up -d mork
```

### B. Convert MeTTa to Binary
Pre-process the BioCypher exports into optimized indices (only needed when data changes).
```bash
python3 scripts/convert_topaths.py [--input-dir <dir>] [--mork-url <url>]
```
-   `--input-dir`: Directory containing `.metta` files (default: `output`)
-   `--mork-url`: MORK service URL (default: `http://localhost:8027`)

#### Switching Data Directories
By default, MORK looks at `./output`. To use a different folder (e.g., `output_human`), you **must** prefix the docker command with the `MORK_DATA_DIR` variable:

```bash
# 1. Start MORK with the specific variable for directory
MORK_DATA_DIR=./output_human docker-compose up -d mork

# 2. Run conversion pointing to the same directory
python3 scripts/convert_topaths.py --input-dir output_human
```

### C. Load into MORK
Map the binary files into the server's memory.
```bash
python3 scripts/load_paths.py [--input-dir <dir>] [--mork-url <url>]
```
-   `--input-dir`: Directory containing `.paths` files (default: `output`)
-   `--mork-url`: MORK service URL (default: `http://localhost:8027`)

### D. Run a Query
Test the connection and verify queries using the internal REPL tool.
```bash
python3 scripts/mork_repl.py [--mork-url <url>]
```
-   `--mork-url`: MORK service URL (default: `http://localhost:8027`)
